# Ministry of Labour - Qatar
## Strategic Proposal: Service Fee Implementation Program

**Date:** November 2025  
**To:** Director General, Ministry of Labour  
**From:** Strategic Planning Department  
**Subject:** Proposal to Implement Documented Fee Recommendations

---

## PROPOSAL SUMMARY

**Request:** Approval to implement service fees for 6 high-impact services over 12 months

**Financial Impact:** +56.7M QAR annual recurring revenue (85% growth)

**Investment Required:** 1.5M QAR (one-time implementation costs)

**ROI:** 2,267% (payback within 2 weeks of operation)

**Risk Level:** Low-Medium (managed through phased approach)

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY

### What We Found

Analysis of service request data (2022-2025) reveals:

✅ **18 services have documented fee suggestions** from operations teams  
✅ **83.7M QAR untapped revenue potential** identified  
✅ **Suggestions include specific QAR amounts** in Arabic operational notes  
✅ **Fee structures are sophisticated:** conditional, tiered, per-person, per-month  

### Why This Matters

These are **not theoretical recommendations** - they are documented suggestions from frontline staff who understand:
- Market acceptance levels
- Service delivery costs  
- User willingness-to-pay
- Implementation feasibility

**Example:** تغيير جهة عمل (job transfers) suggestion states "مئة ريال في حال الجهة الجديدة شركة خاصة" (100 QAR when new employer is private company) - this conditional pricing shows sophisticated policy thinking.

## PROPOSED SOLUTION

### Three-Phase Implementation (12 Months)

#### **Phase 1: Employer-Paid Services (Months 1-4)**
**Revenue Target:** 31.6M QAR annually

**Services:**
1. Employer job transfers → 100 QAR (conditional)
2. Recruitment approval modifications → 3 QAR per modification
3. Exit permit registration → 10 QAR per person

**Why Start Here:**
- Employer-paid (absorbed as business costs)
- Legal compliance requirements (inelastic demand)
- Politically safe (no worker burden)

---

#### **Phase 2: Recurring & Tiered Fees (Months 5-8)**
**Revenue Target:** 22.4M QAR annually

**Services:**
1. Loan worker authorizations → 100 QAR per month
2. Recruitment approvals → 5 QAR (specialized) / 2 QAR (non-specialized)

**Why Second:**
- Builds on Phase 1 success
- More complex fee structures (needs system readiness)
- Historical precedent exists (Interior Ministry fees)

---

#### **Phase 3: Worker-Paid with Safeguards (Months 9-12)**
**Revenue Target:** 9.0M QAR annually (with demand adjustment)

**Services:**
1. Worker-initiated job transfers → 100 QAR (conditional, with waivers)

**Why Last:**
- Politically sensitive (worker-paid)
- Requires careful messaging
- Waiver program for low-income workers
- Only proceed if Phase 1-2 successful

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Risk Matrix

| Risk Category | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|---------------|-------------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Demand drop >15% | Low | High | Phased approach, monitor weekly | Low |
| Political backlash | Low | High | Worker fee waivers, strong messaging | Low |
| System delays | Medium | Medium | Early IT assessment, fallback plans | Low |
| Stakeholder resistance | Low | Medium | Pre-consultation, 45-day notices | Very Low |
| Implementation cost overrun | Medium | Low | Fixed-price contracts, phased budget | Very Low |

**Overall Risk Assessment:** **LOW** - Manageable through proposed mitigation strategies

### Key Risk Mitigations

1. **Demand Monitoring:** Weekly tracking in first 90 days, monthly thereafter
2. **Political Safeguards:** Waiver program, conditional pricing, free alternatives maintained
3. **Stakeholder Engagement:** 45-day notice periods, pre-consultation with business groups
4. **Phased Approach:** Stop-gate after each phase; proceed only if targets met
5. **Communication Strategy:** Emphasize administrative cost recovery, not profit motive
