## 🎓 Understanding Key Terms

### **Revenue**
The money generated from fees
- Example: 1,000 requests × 10 QAR fee = 10,000 QAR revenue

### **Elasticity**
How demand changes when price changes
- `-0.1` = If fee increases 10%, demand decreases 1% (optimistic)
- `-0.5` = If fee increases 10%, demand decreases 5% (pessimistic)
- Use -0.1 for most scenarios

### **Scenario**
A set of fee changes you want to test
- Like a "what-if" plan
- Can include one service or many
- Can be applied and removed anytime

### **Category**
Group of similar services
- Example: All work permits in one category
- Helps organize and plan fees

### **Pareto (80/20)**
Business rule: 20% of things cause 80% of results
- Here: 20% of services = 80% of requests
- Focus on the important 20%

### **Quadrant**
One of four sections in the portfolio chart
- Helps categorize services by volume and revenue
- Each quadrant suggests different strategy
